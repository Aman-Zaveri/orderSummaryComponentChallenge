## My process

1. Planned out how I want to approach this project and how I want to section it out
2. Started centering all the components
3. Change the characteristics of the text
4. Carefully positioned the plan section using flex
5. Completed the project by adding characteristics to the final part. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- Learned how to use border-radius on a few of the edges. 
- Learned how to make an svg a background


### Continued development

During this project, I barely dipped my feet in CSS Grid. I would love to experiment with that feature more and see the capabilities it has.
